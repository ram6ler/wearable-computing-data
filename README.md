## Wearable computer data / readme

This is a project that was done as part of the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) course, [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata). For the project, we were given access to a really untidy data set, [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from the [University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml), from which we were to extract and organise some of the data. The raw data may be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The original data is a large set of values recorded or calculated from gyroscope and accelerometer readings of mobile devices worn by volunteers while engaging in various activities. The basic idea was to see whether such readings may be used to predict the activity.

This repo consists of the following files:

* __README.md__<br>This file, that you are reading.
* [__run_analysis.R__](https://github.com/ram6ler/wearable-computing-data/blob/master/run_analysis.R)<br>The R code that produced the final, tidy data set.
* [__CODEBOOK.md__](https://github.com/ram6ler/wearable-computing-data/blob/master/CODEBOOK.md)<br>An explanation of the variables in the final tidy data set.
