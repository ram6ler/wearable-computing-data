## Wearable computer data / readme

This is a project that was done as part of the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) course, [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata). For the project, we were given access to a really untidy data set, [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from the [University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml), from which we were to extract and organise some of the data. The raw data may be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

This repo consists of the following files:

* __README.md__<br>This file, that you are reading.
* __run_analysis.R__<br>The R code that produced the final, tidy data set.
* __CODEBOOK.md__<br>An explanation of the variables in the final tidy data set.
